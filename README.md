# pitch_detector

Play your musical instrument (optimized for violin) and see the notes appear on a staff, with color indicating whether your intonation is sharp or flat.

Implemented as a single html with all the css and javascript in it.

The app uses the "Yin" pitch detection algorithm. I got the code for hat from https://github.com/peterkhayes/pitchfinder/blob/master/src/detectors/yin.ts

As of May 25, 2020, it works enough, but still to do:

* Make it much prettier
* Display notes with flats, not just sharps
* Correct ledger lines when octives are disposed
* Experiment with different defaults
* Draw prettier
